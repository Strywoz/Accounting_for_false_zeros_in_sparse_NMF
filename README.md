This repository contains all experiments on **synthetic** and **real datasets** (CBCL and TDT2).

- **`run_hals_variants`** implements classical NMF as well as **quadratic** and **linear HALS** methods, and returns the evolution of the **relative reconstruction error** for different values of \(\lambda\).
- **`run_M2`** implements only the **quadratic HALS** method.

Results for **Experiments 1 and 2** are available in their respective folders.
